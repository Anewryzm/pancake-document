# SYRUP

![SYRUP Token](../.gitbook/assets/icon-square-512.png)

**Stack your CAKE with SYRUP.** 

**40% of CAKE emissions** are distributed to SYRUP holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.

* CAKE holders can swap CAKE for SYRUP at a 1:1 ratio.
* CAKE is distributed proportionally at each block based on SYRUP holdings.

SYRUP is also used to earn tokens from [SYRUP Pools](../syrup-pools/syrup-pool.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The chefs strongly recommend that you don't buy, sell, or transfer SYRUP.**

CAKE rewards are only sent to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. Although SYRUP can be sent to other addresses, only the initiating address will receive the CAKE rewards.

In addition, you need SYRUP in order to unstake CAKE from the staking contract.
