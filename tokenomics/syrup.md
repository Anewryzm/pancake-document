{% hint style="warning" %}
**The chefs strongly recommend that you don't buy, sell, or transfer SYRUP.**

CAKE rewards are only sent to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. Although SYRUP can be sent to other addresses, only the initiating address will receive the CAKE rewards.

In addition, you need SYRUP in order to unstake CAKE from the staking contract.
