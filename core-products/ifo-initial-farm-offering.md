# IFO \(Initial Farm Offering\)

### How does it work?

Buy new tokens using CAKE-BNB LP tokens. You'll need to stake equal amounts of CAKE and BNB in a liquidity pool to take part.

[**Get CAKE-BNB LP**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/add/ETH/0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82)\*\*\*\*

The project gets the BNB, PancakeSwap burns the CAKE. **You get the tokens.**

### Want to launch your own IFO?

Launch your project with PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chainâ€™s most-used AMM project and liquidity provider, to bring your token directly to the most active and rapidly growing community on BSC.
